# Uploads Directory

This directory is used to store files uploaded by customers for printing.

In a real production environment, you would:
1. Implement proper file storage on a server or cloud storage solution
2. Add authentication and authorization to protect files
3. Implement file validation and virus scanning
4. Add proper file management capabilities

For this demo application, files are stored in memory and simulated to be in this directory.
